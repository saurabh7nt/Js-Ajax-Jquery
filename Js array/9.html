<!-- indexof() 
    -indexof() method will be used to find the index of that particular element.
    -if you have multiple same elements in an array then indexof() will give you
     the first occurance of that element
    -you can also send second parameter as a index to the method so that the search will be
     start from that index only
    -if you search for an element which is not present in an array then indexof() method
     will give you -1.

    lastindexof()
    -lastIndexOf() works the same as indexOf method the only difference is that this method
    will start searching the element from the last.
