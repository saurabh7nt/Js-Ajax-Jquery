<!-- some() & every()
    -some() method will check the each and every element of array and will return true or
     false as per the condition
    -in this method you have to create a function which will check the condition
    -this function will return true even if one of the element passes the condition
    but
    in every() method each case must be passed to get the true outcome.
    -working of every() method is same as some()method except the above difference.
