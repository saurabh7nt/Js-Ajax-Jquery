<!-- 
    for character sets we use [] 
    [a-z]
    - this allows all the character from a to z in lowercase
    [A-Z]
    - this charset allow the character from A to Z in uppercase
    [0-9]
    - all numeric values between 0-9 are acceptable
    [^a-z]
    - here ^ means that values between a-z are not allowed
    [^abch]
    - any value without these abch are acceptable
    -you can have as many charset in an expression as many you want

    for quantifiers we use {}
    
    - quantifier means number of times the character can repeat/occur 
    
    h{2}
    - here letter h can occur exact 2 times....nor less non more
    h{0,2}
    - here letter can occur from 0 to 2 times.

    for grouping we use ()

    (sh){2}
    -here sh can occur exactly 2 times
