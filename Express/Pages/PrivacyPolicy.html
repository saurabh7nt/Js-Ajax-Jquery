                        <br>
                        <h5 style="text-align: center;">1) UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION & PRIVACY PREFERENCES:</h5>
                        <p>
                            a) As a visitor of the ‘Web-Site’, you can engage in limited activities without providing any ‘Personal information’.
                            <br>
                            b) In order to have access to all the features and benefits on the ‘Web-Site’, a ‘User’ shall be required to register and create an account by first providing certain ‘Personal Information’ [as well as certain non-personal information that may be tied to ‘Personal Information’], that shall include but not be limited to your first and last name, mailing address [including ZIP code/ Postal code], alternate E-mail Address, Age, Gender and Telephone/ Mobile Numbers or Contact Details, Credit/ Debit Card/ Bank Account Details, etc. in-order to provide you with access to all the features and benefits on the ‘Web-Site’. Where possible, the ‘Web-Site’ indicates which fields are mandatorily required and which are optional with the use of the [*] symbol similarly, if you wish to delete your information that is mandatory, you will not be able to engage in that particular activity.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h5 style="text-align: center;">3)PROTECTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND DATA SECURITY:</h5>
                        <P>

                            d) Once any ‘Personal Information’ comes into the possession of NHRPL, NHRPL will take reasonable steps to protect that information from misuse and loss and from unauthorized access, modification or disclosure.
                        </P>
                        <br>
                        <h5 style="text-align: center;">3) STORAGE OF DATA:
                        </h5>

                        </P>
                        <br>
                        <h5 style="text-align: center;">
                            4) LOG INFORMATION, USER COMMUNICATIONS:
                        </h5>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h5 style="text-align: center;">
                            5) PRIVACY OF CHILDREN:
                        </h5>      
                        <p>
