What is AJAX?
AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
AJAX is not a programming language.
AJAX just uses a combination of:
 A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data
from a web server)
 JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)
AJAX is a misleading name. AJAX applications might use XML to
transport data, but it is equally common to transport data as
plain text or JSON text.
AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by
exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This
means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without
reloading the whole page.

AJAX Introduction
AJAX is a developer's dream, because you can:
 Read data from a web server - after the page has loaded
 Update a web page without reloading the page
 Send data to a web server - in the background
AJAX Example Explained
HTML Page
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<div id="demo">
<h2>Let AJAX change this text</h2>
<button type="button" onclick="loadDoc()">Change
Content</button>
</div>
</body>
</html>
The HTML page contains a <div> section and a <button>.
The <div> section is used to display information from a server.
The <button> calls a function (if it is clicked).
The function requests data from a web server and displays it:
Function loadDoc()
function loadDoc() {
var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
 if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
 document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = this.responseText;
        }
    }
xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_info.txt", true);
xhttp.send();
}
