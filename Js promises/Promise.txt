Promise:
-promise in js works same as promise in real world
-let me give you an analogy
-suppose you got a call from your friend and you promise that person to meet on this weekend
 so here there are two chances, either the promise will get fulfilled or it will get rejected.
-same in this case
-promise is special function where we can give two parameters
 as resolve or rejected.
-we have to handle both conditions,,,if promise get resolved
....and also if the promise get rejected.

To handle these there are two methods :
1) .then (if promise get resolved)
2) .catch (if promise get rejected)
