Rest operator :
- Rest operator will break the rest of the elements into an array to perform certain actions on
  it.
- Rest operator is always use at the end of the formal arguments.


Spread operator :
- Spread operator is exactly opposite to the rest operator
- It breaks the array into each individual element so that we can perform certain actions on it.
- It is also possible to concatenate two arrays into one array with the help of spread operator.
- Example:
            let x = [10,20,30];
            let y = [40,50];
            let z = [...x,...y];
            let z = [0,...x,...y,60,70,80]; 
- It is also possible to add elements into new array.
